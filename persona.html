          <p>Jacob is a paralegal in a law firm. He reviews cases and writes summaries, cross-referencing them to the
            clients. He's building expertise in law and is hoping to go to law school in a year.
            He's a bit of a gadget geek, always trying out new tools. He likes the challenge of learning new tools. His
            other challenge is running. He's training for a 10K run, running with a club in his neighborhood and using
            an
            app to plan his routes and track his distance.

            As far as Jacob is concerned, it's the technology that's handicapped, not him. When everything is in place,
            he
            can work just as fast and just as effectively as anyone in his office.

          <p>
            The last few years have been a lot of fun with all the new apps, and VoiceOver on his Mac and phone lets him
            use most of them pretty well.
            He's just started to use the iPhone app, Passbook, and uses it to get train tickets and other travel. The
            regional rail system has an app, so he can just pull up the barcode and scan it at the ticket office. No
            fumbling for the right printed card - total independence. Same phone as everyone. Same app as everyone, and
            it
            all just works.
